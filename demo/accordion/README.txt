A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/chenyakun/pen/addqPa.

 Inspired by Ch3mical.com.

I saw this accordion at Paul Kelley's website. He had used jQuery and images to achieve the effect. I decided to take a CSS3 approach and use elements instead of images. I have use Genericons font for the social networking icons.

Forked from [Ren Aysha](http://codepen.io/rrenula/)'s Pen [Pure CSS Horizontal Accordion](http://codepen.io/rrenula/pen/DGrhf/).
