A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/chenyakun/pen/adYMGw.

 An experiment with some buttons attempting to follow Google's material design guidelines. Also, borrowing a very cool SVG version of the ink ripple effect by Jonathan Cutrell - uses jQuery's animate method.

Additionally, giving the Attribute Modules concept another go - it's a technique for using attributes and their values rather than classes for styling HTML elements. Low specificity is definitely a plus.
