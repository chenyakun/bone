Note that the function named append_some_a_to_b, which implements the callback flow for the
task, places the declaration of the callback functions inline, which leads to this deeply nested code.
To the untrained eye, code structured this way can be hard to read.
Worse yet, if you needed to conditionally perform some I/O before the final operation, structuring
the code this way could lead to a lot of duplication.
